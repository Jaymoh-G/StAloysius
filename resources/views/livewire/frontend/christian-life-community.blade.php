                        <p>At the heart of our Christian life lies the belief that faith is not simply something we profess, but something we must actively live out. St. Ignatius of Loyola, taught us that we are called to be “contemplatives in action.” This concept encourages us to balance prayer and reflection with a commitment to serve others. To be contemplative in action means that while we take time to connect with God through prayer, reflection, and spiritual practices, we also understand that our faith calls us to go out into the world and make a difference.</p>
                        <p>St. Ignatius’ vision was clear: true contemplation leads us to action. As we deepen our relationship with God through prayer, we discern His will for our lives and are then led to act in ways that serve and love others. Faith in action is not a passive experience; it is an active one that demands we work for justice, help those in need, and reflect God’s love through our every action.</p>

                        <p>As St. Al’s Community, we are called to be contemplatives in action. This means we must live out our school motto Learn, Love, and Serve not just as a set of ideals, but as guiding principles for our daily lives. When we learn, we are called to grow in wisdom and understanding; when we love, we are called to act with compassion and empathy; and when we serve, we are called to embody the very essence of our faith, using our talents and resources for the good of others.</p>
                        <p>True service is rooted in love, and no one exemplified this more than St. Ignatius of Loyola. He taught that love, when truly felt, compels us to act. For Ignatius, love was not a passive emotion but an active force that led to service and sacrifice for the good of others. In his Spiritual Exercises, Ignatius taught that every action we take should be driven by a deep love for God and neighbor.</p>

                        <h3 class="mb-2">When we serve, we reflect God’s love</h3>
                        <p>As we reflect on this teaching, we are reminded that serving with love is not about seeking recognition or reward, but about responding to the needs of others with humility and compassion. When we serve, we reflect God’s love, not just through grand gestures, but through simple, everyday acts of kindness and care. This is how we live out our school motto: Learn, Love, and Serve. In learning, we grow in our understanding of God’s love; in loving, we serve others with a heart full of compassion; and in serving, we transform our community and the world around us.</p>

                          <p>On this St. Al’s Day, we must also acknowledge the tremendous generosity of the School of Hope Foundation. Their unwavering support has been instrumental in helping St. Al’s continue its mission of providing quality education to students in need. The generosity of the School of Hope Foundation is a true reflection of the values we hold dear—learning, loving, and serving—as they have not only provided financial support but have also invested in the future of our students and the broader community.</p>
                        <p>Through their contributions, we are able to expand our resources, improve our facilities, and offer scholarships to students who may not have had access to education otherwise. Their generosity is a reminder that love in action has the power to change lives, and we are deeply grateful for their ongoing support.</p><p>
In the spirit of Learn, Love, and Serve, it is vital that we honor the trust and generosity of our donors with integrity. At CLC Kenya, we pledge to be transparent and responsible stewards of every donation we receive. The donations we receive will be directed towards improving our school’s operations, enhancing the educational experience of our students, and ensuring that we can continue to offer the best possible environment for learning and growth.</p><p>
We understand the responsibility we bear in managing these resources, and we are committed to using them in alignment with the values of our school. Integrity is not just about being honest; it is about being responsible in how we use the resources entrusted to us. By ensuring every donation is used effectively and responsibly, we honor the generosity of our donors and continue to live out the school’s motto of Learn, Love, and Serve.</p><p>
Let us recommit ourselves to the values of Faith in Action – Serving with Love and Integrity. Inspired by St. Ignatius of Loyola, let us live as contemplatives in action—praying, reflecting, and then acting in service to others. Let us remember that in learning, we grow in wisdom; in loving, we serve with compassion; and in serving, we live out our faith in the world.
Let us be reminded that every action, no matter how small, is an opportunity to live the values of our school motto: Learn, Love, and Serve. Together, we can continue to build a community rooted in faith, love, and integrity—transforming lives and making a lasting difference in our world.
